To compile the programs:
  
  1. Edit the configuration parameters defined in "Makefile" of 
     this directory.
  2. Type 'make'.


To check if the PMML compiler is properly compiled:

  1. Type 'make test'.

This will run the PMML compiler across some testing codes, and
compare resulting MIDI files with reference MIDI files.  If the
comparison for "test1.mid" or "test2.mid" is failed, it means that the
PMML compiler is corrupted.  If the comparison for "test3.mid" is
failed, it doesn't necessarily mean the corruption.  Due to the
incompatibility in floating-point arithmetic, slightly different 
velocity or control values may be generated on some combination of 
machines and C compilers.
Try to translate "test3.mid" and "test3.ref" to ASCII texts by 
"pmml - e'dump()' -l MIDIFILE", and check if the difference is trivial.


To install the compiled executable file and library files:

  1. Type 'make install'.

Our Emacs Lisp program is not installed by 'make install'. 
Please copy emacs/pmml-mode.el manually to an appropriate directory.
