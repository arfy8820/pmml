- allow the "$smfout" effector to pass events to the next effector rather
  than absorbing them (maybe useful in generating multiple SMFs)?

- pack some "Out of range" warning messages to one? 

- show line number for "Out of range" warning messages (This will require 
  additional memory because we have to keep the line number for each event)?

- give warning to unreferenced macros?

- give warning to infinity loops?

- allow macros to take arguments whose style is { ... } ?

- allow to associate a user-definable attribute (of any data type) with 
  each note event?

- allow the "case(note)" action of effectors to receive the number of
  sharp or flat signs? 

- allow effector actions to obtain the value of the "dt" register?

- unify interthread messages with events?
