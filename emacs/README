About the PMML editing mode for Emacs (including Mule or Nemacs)
----------------------------------------------------------------

This PMML editing mode is supposed to be used in either of the following
two configurations: 

  1) In combination with a third-party standard MIDI file player (Only 
     playing will be supported)
  2) In combination with a dedicated server program (Both playing and 
     recording will be supported)

At present, the dedicated server program is not realesed yet, 
and therefore, 1) is the only way of the use.


How to use the PMML editing mode
--------------------------------
* Preparation

Add the following three lines to your ".emacs".
The "pmml-player-command" variable should be set to the command name 
and command line arguments for the standard MIDI file player that you use
with each command argument being enclosed in double-quotes.

;; PMML mode setup
(setq pmml-player-command '("timidity" "-s16000"))
(require 'pmml-mode)

When "pmml-mode.el" is installed in a non-standard directory,
the directory needs to be added to the "load-path" variable 
prior to calling the "require" function above.

* How to get started

When you open a file whose file name extension is ".pml",
the editing mode automatically goes to the PMML mode.

* Basic operations

Like the C mode, TAB is recognized as a auto-indenting command rather than
inserting the TAB character itself. 

To play the work from the beginning, type "C-c C-f". 

To stop the playing, type "C-c C-q".

To play the work from the current position of the point (cursor), 
type "C-c C-p", 
N.B.: When the point is located in a macro argument or in a comment, 
      this may not work. 

To play the work from the current position of the point regarding to
only the track where the point is put, type  "C-c p", 

For other information, try M-x describe-mode or M-x describe-function.
