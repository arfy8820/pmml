This directory contains a complete data set of  
the 1st movement from the Piano Concerto by E. Grieg
with full musical expression control.

In this work, no exclusive messages are used; therefore, it can be played
on most of GM synthesizers with acceptable quality.  Volume and velocity 
were adjusted by comparing sounds generated by a GS synthesizer and
XG synthesizer so that either type of synthesizer can achieve a good 
balance of dynamics.  They sound like performances with different 
orchestra by the same conductor.

The work is divided into four files: grieg1.pml, grieg2.pml,
grieg3.pml and grieg4.pml.  
The second file (grieg2.pml) describes a segment of the music 
which is repeated two times with small variations.

Each file can be translated into standard MIDI file separately
with the following steps:

  pmml grieg1
  pmml -o grieg2a -e'times=1' grieg2
  pmml -o grieg2b -e'times=2' grieg2
  pmml grieg3
  pmml grieg4

The generated MIDI files are self-contained, i.e, each of them gives
a correct performance for a segment of the music.

To make a MIDI file for the full performance, execute the following:

  pmml grieg

It will read the MIDI files generated above and merges into one.

Just type 'make' for going through the above procedure.

Enjoy!
